My js13kgames.com competition entry... "At Sea".  Final size 13,309 bytes tested working in Chrome, FireFox and Opera.

For Internet Explorer usage see the [v1.1 branch](https://github.com/scottheckel/js13kgames/tree/v1.1-ie).  This is still under the limit at 13,306 bytes but it took until after the competition deadline to complete.

No Mobile functionality yet.
